Note that the random number sampling can be done both in `numpy` and `scipy`, but we recommend using Generators from `numpy` if possible. `seaborn` is a nice visualization package for statistics built upon `matplotlib`. We wrap the samples using dataframes from `pandas` for direct access when plotting."
